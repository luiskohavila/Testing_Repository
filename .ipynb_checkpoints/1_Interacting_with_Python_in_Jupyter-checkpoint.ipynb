    "\n",
    "Python was born in the late 1980s. Its creator, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), named it after the British comedy \"Monty Python's Flying Circus.\" His goal was to create \"an easy and intuitive language just as powerful as major competitors,\" producing computer code \"that is as understandable as plain English.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that Python is a _general-purpose_ language, which means that you can use it for anything:  organizing data, scraping the web, creating websites, analyzing sounds, creating games, and of course _engineering computations_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an _interpreted_ language. This means that you can write Python commands and the computer can execute those instructions directly. Other programming languages—like C, C++ and Fortran—require a previous _compilation_ step: translating the commands into machine language.\n",
    "A neat ability of Python is to be used _interactively_. [Fernando Perez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Pérez_(software_developer) famously created **IPython** as a side-project during his PhD. The \"I\" in IPython stands for interactive: a style of computing that is very powerful for developing ideas and solutions incrementally, thinking with the computer as a kind of collaborator. "

    "Your time is more valuable than a machine's!\n",
